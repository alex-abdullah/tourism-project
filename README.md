# Tourism Project

Here is my project. Enjoy! :)

## Main Objective:

Create a website that has the following:

-   landing / home page with info on it
-   Gallery to showcase images of location
-   Getting there information
-   Contact page with email, GitHub profile link
-   README.md at root of file

### Website vision

I wanted to keep the page very simple across all of the pages. My central idea was to guide the user through the page starting from home page through to the gallery.

### Development log

-> There were a couple of drafts of the website that I played around with that I ended up scrapping due to opimisation issues.

-> I settled with 2 main display options for the website:

-   more than 700px for desktop users
-   less than 700px for mobile device users

-> A big hurdle later on in development has been utilising modules, partials and mixins in my flow. There was a large deal of restructing required to integrate these into my CSS at first.
Although, if I was to redo the website project from scratch, I would definitely have started with creating my variables, partials etc first BEFORE moving onto fully fleshing out the styling of the site.

-> I feel as though I my use of BEM is a little bit hit and miss. I can certainly acknowledge that the naming of some of the elements and modifiers could be a lot clearer than what they currently are.

-> Chrome developer tools helped TREMENDOUSLY when testing out optimisations and other stylings

### Additional development notes

-> social media icons were sourced from Font Awesome;

-> website font sourced from Google Fonts
